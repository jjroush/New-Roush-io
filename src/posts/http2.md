I began looking into HTTP2 because I was Node.js was implementing native support. As I really began to dive in, it was puzzling why people wern't making a bigger deal out of updating the decades-old HTTP1 spec. There were less examples than I anticipated for setting Node.js with HTTP2 and I thought javascript developers where ahead of the curve.

## HTTP mini history lesson

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is is how we access information on that good old world wide web.
HTTP 1.1 came out in 1997. A lot has changed since 1997, cell phones have jurasticly changed as well as computers, HTTP had not changed from 1997 until 2015

### Speed Test (Unscientific)

### Server Push

## Conclusion

Now hold up before you feel to excited for feeling ahead of the curve on this HTTP stuff. In 2018 HTTP3 began to enter the market orgininally developed by Google under the name of Quic. HTTP3 is set to become a standard sometime soon but for now I plan to make sure I'm caught up with 2015's technology.
