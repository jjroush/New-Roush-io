It's 2:00am on a Saturday. Eyes glued to the screen of your computer, you're questioning life choices. Could've been out with friends or sleeping but instead you've chosen to debug why OAuth on your app isn't working with a bunch of other insane people powered by yellow Red Bull and the adrenaline when your application finally starts up. This sums up Hackathons quite well for me.
