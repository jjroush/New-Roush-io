It's 2:00am on a Saturday. Eyes glued to the screen of your computer, you're questioning life choices.

I had a concept on my mind to work on a developer recruiting tool that would find candidates using the GitHub API. Our team had also planned to process the GitHub data with TensorFlow but we were not able to
