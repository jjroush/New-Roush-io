I recently learned . In the name of learning more about worker threads, I decided to node script wihch could leverage the benefit of threading

1. Keep the event loop unblocked.
1. Make stuff faster through parallelization.

# Worker Threads at a Glance

At a glance, JavaScript is single-threaded. Worker threads allow 



# Demo 

For this Demo I needed a CPU-intensive task

```

for (let i = 0; i < passwordArray.length; i++) {
    const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(passwordArray[i]).digest('hex');
    if (hash === hashInput) {
        match = passwordArray[i];
    }
} 
```

# Benefits

As shown from the demo, we are able to use worker threads in Node to make cpu-intensive tasks non-blocking and speeding up by working in parallel.



# TL:DR;
