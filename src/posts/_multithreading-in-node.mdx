I recently learned . In the name of learning more about worker threads, I decided to node script wihch could leverage the benefit of threading

1. Keep the event loop unblocked.
1. Make stuff faster through parallelization.

# Worker Threads at a Glance

At a glance, JavaScript is single-threaded. Worker threads allow 



# Demo

# Benefits

As shown from the demo, we are able to use worker threads in Node to make cpu-intensive tasks non-blocking and speeding up by working in parallel.



# TL:DR;
